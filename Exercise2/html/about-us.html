                <h4>About me</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm in my final year of Computer Science at the Athens University of Economics and Business. 
                    Over the course of my studies, I've gained a solid grounding in programming, web development, and 
                    data analysis. As I get ready to graduate, Iâ€™m looking forward to finding opportunities where I 
                    can keep learning and growing in the field.

                <h4>About Me</h4>
                <p>
                    I am a graduating student from the Department of Informatics at the Athens University of
                    Economics and Business, with a passion for Web Development and modern internet technologies.
                    Early on, I discovered my love for designing and implementing web applications, and I 
                    dedicate time to developing my skills in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy learning new
                    techniques and practices that enhance user experience, and I am always looking for ways
                    to grow and deliver better results.
